    # When adding member {FileSetBehavior}s to a {WorkBehavior}, {Hyrax} saves
    # and reloads the work for each new member FileSet. This can significantly
    # slow down ingest for Works with many member FileSets. The saving and
    # reloading happens in {FileSetActor#attach_to_work}.
    #
    # This is a 'swappable' alternative approach. It will be of most value to
    # Hyrax applications dealing with works with many filesets. Anecdotally, a
    # 600 FileSet work can be processed in ~15 mins versus >3 hours with the
    # standard approach.
    #
    # The tradeoff is that the ordered members are now added in a single step
    # after the creation of all the FileSets, thus introducing a slight risk of
    # orphan filesets if the upload fails before the addition of the ordered members.
    # This has not been observed in practice.
    #
    # Swapping out the actors can be achieved thus:
    #
    # In +config/initializers/hyrax.rb+:
    #
    #   Hyrax::CurationConcern.actor_factory.swap(Hyrax::Actors::CreateWithFilesActor,
    #     Hyrax::Actors::CreateWithFilesOrderedMembersActor)
    #
    # Alternatively, in +config/application.rb+:
    #
    #   config.to_prepare
    #     Hyrax::CurationConcern.actor_factory.swap(Hyrax::Actors::CreateWithFilesActor,
    #       Hyrax::Actors::CreateWithFilesOrderedMembersActor)
    #   end
    #
    # Creates a work and attaches files to the work
    class CreateWithFilesOrderedMembersActor < CreateWithFilesActor
      # @return [TrueClass]
      def attach_files(files, curation_concern, user_id, attributes)
        return true if files.blank?

        AttachFilesToWorkWithOrderedMembersJob
          .perform_later(curation_concern, files, attributes.to_h.symbolize_keys)
        true
      end
    end
  end
end
