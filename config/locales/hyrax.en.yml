        Dear %{depositor},
        <p>
        Thank you for your submission to Deep Blue Data. The metadata record for
        &quot;<a href='%{url}'>%{title}</a>&quot; has been created, and we will
        begin the review process as soon as your data and documentation are complete.
        (You will receive a separate email confirming your file uploads when this is done).
        </p>
        <p>
        We are happy to provide you with a personalized curation review to ensure your data are as easy as possible to
        understand and use. This entails:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Review of your data and documentation.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>If you would like more information or resources on creating appropriate documentation for your deposit, see our

        <li>We may work with the <a href='https://datacurationnetwork.org/'>Data Curation Network</a> (DCN) to
        perform the full review of your collection. The DCN is a consortium through which we have access to a broad
        range of subject and format expertise for curation.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Curation recommendations for your dataset (our usual timeline for review is a week or two; if you are working
        on a more compressed timeline, let us know).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        After the review we may request additional information or revisions to your deposit so that we can best
        represent your collection.
